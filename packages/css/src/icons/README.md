# Material Icons

Milj√∏direktoratets design system now uses Material Icons, and icon fonts.

To use `MdIcon` please follow all guidelines regarding accessibility and aria-attributes. `MdIcon` accepts the standard attributes for a regular `span` element.

Font Awesome has a nice, simple guide on accessibility and icon fonts: [Font Awesome Accessibility](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/dig-deeper/accessibility).
Please also see WCAG for more info: [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/Techniques/aria/ARIA24)

This component is for use in React apps, but for those that use other frameworks, there should be plenty of options on how to include
Material Icons into your project/framework.
